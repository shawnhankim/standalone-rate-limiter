"""Rate Limiter for Managing Quota for Global System and All Users

Features:
=========
  1. Configuring global or user level rate-limit
  2. Processing rate-limit request
  3. Managing rate-limit buckets

Time and Space Complexity:
+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Assumption | - # of global limiters: 1                                      |
|            | - # of users          : N                                      |
|            | - range of N          : 0 <= N <= 500,000,000 (500M)           |
|            | - The requests-per-sec (rps) limit is set globally or per-user.|
|            |   If both are set, only the user's limit should be used.       |
|            | - The rate limiter runs only on one machine in one process.    |

| Time       |   Algorithm  | Insert | Search | Update | Delete               |
| Complexity | -------------+--------+--------+--------+--------              |
|            | - Average    | O(1)   | O(1)   | O(1)   | O(1)                 |
|            | - Worst Case | O(N)   | O(N)   | O(N)   | O(N)                 |
+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Space      | - Average    : O(N)                                            |
| Complexity | - Worst Case : O(N)                                            |
+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

Pros and Cons:
+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Pros       | - Time efficient                                               |
|            |   + buckets     : average CRUD O(1) for buckets                |
|            |   + each bucket : O(1), don't use queue, hash table            |
|            | - Memory efficient: don't manage real queue in each bucket.    |
|            | - Allows a burst for short periods than fixed window algorithm.|
|            | - Easy to reset available quota at the end of time window fits |
+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Cons       | - Minimum time window: 1 second (miliseconds aren't accurate.) |
|            |   e.g. requests: #1(0:000001), #2(0:999999) -> deny            |
|            |                  #1(0:000001), #2(1:000001) -> allow           |
|            |   There may have small error rate of floating point. But, it   |
|            |   would be normally allowed unless strict rule is required.    |
|            | - Additional bursts and delays are not supported.              |
|            | - Concurrent users requests + HA are not supported yet.        |
|            | - Limited types: multi types aren't supported per global/user. |
+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

Future Improvements:
====================
  1. Functional Requirements:
     - Support multiple types per global and user.
       + Security/sys-performance: quota per second -> reject API requests.
       + Monetization: quota per month, year -> integrate w/ analytics.
       -> The current solution provides key/value bucket mangements so the ways
          of configuration and retrival might be refactored.

     - Enhance a burst and delay count if product requirements are needed.
       + As-is: The request needs be retried by clients if the reponse code is
                429 from rate-limiter that is to protect from malicious attack.
       + To-be: The rate-limiter handles proper amount of exceeded requests
                within some time window so that it would be smoother solution.

  2. Non-Functional Requirements for Scalability, Reliability, Security
     - Support a distributed rate-limiting solution.
     - Reduce the number of calls to distributed rate limiter.
     - Combine between an in-memory and distributed rate-limiter.

     e.g. - Add session mgmt and token validation integrating w/ IdP.
          - The API GW itself can use in-memory rate-limiter if it is to
            mitigate malicious attack. If it is for tracking quota for the
            purpose of monetization or data analytics, then we can combine
            both approaches between in-memory and distributed rate-limiters.
